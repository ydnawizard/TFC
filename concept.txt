Terminal Flash Cards (TFC) is a flash card CLI
that is written in c. Notably, it has the ability to import
new card stacks if they are definied correctly in
an external text file.

There is a menu from which you can modify rules like: which
side is shown, an answer timer, and shuffling parameters. 
This menu also lets you view your card stack library and switch
between stacks.
